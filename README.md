# Python-Web-Crawler
### This is a python based multi-threaded web crawling spider
#### If you wonder what a web crawler is, then-
A Web crawler is an Internet bot which helps in Web indexing. They crawl one page at a time through a website until all pages have been indexed. Web crawlers help in collecting information about a website and the links related to them, and also help in validating the HTML code and hyperlinks.

A Web crawler is also known as a Web spider, automatic indexer or simply crawler.

## Getting Started
Although this program does not require any of those fancy libraries available out there for crawling; following are the basic libraries required for running this crawler, which comes bundled in almost every python interpreter:
```
* urllib
* html
```

1. One needs to **run only the main.py** file.
2. Enter the project folder name (Any name, it's upto you).
3. Enter the URL you want to crawl.

And that's it.
Now, just sit back and let your multi-threaded spiders do the job.
